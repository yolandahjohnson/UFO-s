# UFOs
 
## Overview of Project

Dana, the client, wanted to create a webpage regarding UFO sightings. This was done by building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were created to make the table interactive for the user. This interactive table was then placed into an HTML file and using Bootstrap a customized webpage was created. Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.
