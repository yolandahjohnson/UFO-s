# UFOs
 
## Overview of Project

Dana, the client, wanted to create a webpage regarding UFO sightings. This was done by building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were created to make the table interactive for the user. This interactive table was then placed into an HTML file and using Bootstrap a customized webpage was created. Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results

## The Truth Is Out There

## How it works
The user has the option of entering either the date, city, state, country, or shape or any combination of the search criteria. This will return any sightings matching the selected criteria.

### Example
The user entered "or", for Oregon, in the state search box and the below results were returned. To reset the search the user would click on "UFO Sightings" in the upper left corner of the webpage.

## Summary

### Drawback
While the webpage is functional there are some drawbacks. One being, in order to do a proper search the user would have to know the specific date, city, state, country, or shape. Additionally, they would have to know that it's case specific. (i.e., all lowercase)

### Rcommendations
Some enhancements that can be done to make it easier for the user to navigate through the table are:
- When the user enters a search in any box and executes the search, the pre-populated search suggestions should be cleared out. 
- For the city, state, country, and shape search criteria, a drop down arrow can be added that lists all available options.
- For the date search criteria an option to either search the year or a date range can be added.
